# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm interested in IT, programming in object-oriented languages such as Java and astronomy; I am also a beginner graphic designer. I love science subjects, i.e. mathematics and physics - I hate chemistry.
I am a secondary school student from Poland. I like to make new friends, play various games with others and talk (with this conversation it is even sometimes too much XD). Fun fact: I love horror movies and I have a dog
